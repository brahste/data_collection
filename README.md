# Data Collection

This repository was used during my MASc to develop a high-volumne dataset 
of vibration signals arising from various terrains. Using a dynamically configurable 
parameter the value given for specific terrains was altered at the transition barrier
between terrains, thus allowing a label to be associated with each vibrational sample 
taken from the IMU attached to the rover chassis.
